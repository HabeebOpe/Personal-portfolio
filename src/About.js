            <p>Once again, I'm Habeebullah Okunlola, a web developer and a designer passionate about bringing creativity and innovation to projects. I discovered my love for coding in 2021 through a friend and found my niche in problem-solving during HTML practice sessions.</p>
            <p>As a designer, what sets me apart is the desire to infuse my design skills into every project. The compliments I receive from friends and fellow developers upon completing projects serve as motivation, driving me to continue building.</p>
            <p>In addition to web development, I'm a Biotechnology student at Osun State University, Osogbo. The intersection of biotechnology and software engineering presents exciting opportunities. Advancements in coding can enhance data analysis, modeling, and automation in biotechnological research.</p>
            <p>Understanding both fields allows for innovative solutions at the interface of biology and technology. Excited about collaborating with like-minded individuals, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my passion for technology and biotechnology.</p>
            <p>Let's explore the possibilities together!</p>
